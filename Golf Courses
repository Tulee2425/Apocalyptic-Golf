# I would like courses that have 9 hole courses, 18 hole courses, and 36 hole courses.
# 9 holes would be the easy levels.
# 18 holes would be the intermediate levels.
# 36 holes would be the hardest levels.
# I would also like to add mini golf courses for single player mode, and multiplayer mode.
The courses would be on Earth with multiple scenarios like regular courses, courses in a metropolitan area, courses on the clouds, courses under water, and courses under ground in caves.
# There would also be courses in outer space on different planets, on different moons, and on different well known constellations and places like the rings of Saturn and the Milky Way.
