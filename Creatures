# I would like different types of creatures that would attack the players at random depending on where the player hits their golf ball. I think it would be viable if the players get attacked when hitting the balls either out of bounds, in the water hazard, or in a sand trap. However, since courses are in different scenarios then the hazards would be more than just those normal three options.
# Creature-1 = Zombies
# Creature-1 = Aliens
# Creature-3 = Rabbid/Zombie Animals, Rabbid/Zombie Sea Creatures
# Creature-4 = Rabbid/Zombie Insects
# Creatures-5 = Not a creature, instead a disease, or a random item that falls on the player.
